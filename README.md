# Premier League Player Stat Report
An interactive HTML document showcasing Premier League player performance data, including xG, from ESPN and Understat. 

This interactive player summary uses the same data as is used in the _Premier League Stat Attack_ RShiny dashboard, which showcases Premier League results and xG data sourced from ESPN and Understat, respectively. The HTML product presents shot data (also from Understat) for each player on an interactive pitch, including shot position, xG, opponent and last action. Some of the code used to scrape data from Understat was sourced from ewenme's understatr package on GitHub (https://github.com/ewenme/understatr) and the code used to create the interactive pitch was sourced from https://github.com/FCrSTATS/StatsBomb_WomensData.

The HTML summary is hosted by shinyapps.io and is available at https://mlynch98.shinyapps.io/Premier-League-Player-Stat-Report/.
